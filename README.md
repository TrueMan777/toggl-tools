**Key Features:**
- Lists all time entries without tags
- Configurable date range and minimum duration
- Multiple output formats (table, CSV, JSON)
- Sorting options by date, duration, or description
- Summary statistics of total untagged time

### ü§ñ Toggl Auto Tagger

Automatically assigns tags to Toggl time entries based on their descriptions using customizable mapping rules.

**Key Features:**
- Automatically tags entries based on description patterns
- Creates a template mapping file with all available tags
- Interactive mode to confirm each tag assignment
- Dry run mode to preview changes without applying them
- Detailed statistics on applied tags

Automatically tag Toggl time entries based on their descriptions.

```
python auto_tagger.py [options]
```

Options:
- `--api-key API_KEY`: Toggl API key (overrides environment variable and .env file)
- `--days DAYS`: Number of days to look back (default: 7)
- `--timezone TIMEZONE`: Timezone for time calculations (default: Asia/Shanghai)
- `--verbose`: Enable verbose logging
- `--dry-run`: Show what would be tagged without making changes

#### Tag Mapping File

The tag mapping file is a JSON file that maps tags to description patterns. The format is:

```json
{
  "Tag1": [
    "pattern1",
    "pattern2"
  ],
  "Tag2": [
    "pattern3",
    "pattern4"
  ]
}
```

**Note on pattern matching:**
- Patterns are matched as whole words only, using word boundaries.
- For example, the pattern "eat" will match "Let's eat lunch" but not "eating lunch".
- Regex patterns are supported for more complex matching.
- If a description matches patterns for multiple tags, all matching tags will be applied.

You can create a template mapping file with all available tags using the `--create-mapping` option.
